The Very Thirsty Plant & the Labyrinth of Ghosts
-------

This game was originally created during Kenney Jam 2022, a 48 hour game jam where you are only allowed to use art assets made by Kenney. The theme of the jam was *Growth*. It has since received updates.

This was developed using [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [knockout](https://github.com/knockout/knockout), and a canvas. Looking back at my bizarre decision to not use a game engine for this game jam, I feel like it was an error. I don't intend to release any major content updates for this game, but I want to maintain it.

This is a game about retrieving water for a plant. Unfortunately, the water doesn't cause the plant to grow, and instead, it causes the forest around the plant to grow. Each time you water the plant, the path you must take to retrieve more water will grow longer and longer. Can you escape the deadly grasps of the ghosts that lie within this ever growing forest labyrinth? Probably not forever.

Ghosts knock you back when you get too close to them, but beware, if they push you against a wall with enough force, you will die.
